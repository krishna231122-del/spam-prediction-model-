Spam Classifier (Machine Learning Project)
An end-to-end machine learning project that classifies SMS messages as **Spam** or **Not Spam (Ham)** using **TF-IDF** and **Naive Bayes**.

This project covers the complete ML pipeline — from data cleaning and EDA to model training, evaluation, and saving the model for future predictions.

 Project Overview
 Spam messages often contain promotional or misleading content.  
 This project builds a supervised ML model to automatically detect such messages.

Machine Learning Approach
Text Preprocessing**
  - Lowercasing
  - Removing numbers & punctuation
  - Cleaning extra spaces
Feature Extraction
  - TF-IDF (Term Frequency – Inverse Document Frequency)
Model
  - Multinomial Naive Bayes

- Evaluation Metrics
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-score
  - Accuracy

 tech Stack used :-

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Joblib
